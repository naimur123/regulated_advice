Thankfully, much has changed in the decades since; though I’m still passionate about tea, I’ll never be exactly green fingered!

Over those years since starting in this line of work, I have gained and developed experience largely by being “at the coal face”, getting involved on a day to day basis with the work and development of clients businesses – often being instrumental in the establishment of many self-invested/self-administered pension schemes enabling businesses to tax efficiently acquire premises.

Alongside these often complex processes goes hand in hand the need to protect the business owners, their families and their employees – this may involve formal trusts or agreements, but often it develops into a plan encompassing the succession of both business as well as personal assets, whether this involves Capital Gains or Inheritance Tax planning solutions.

As an entrepreneur, I have worked with many business men and women over the years, from growing their businesses to selling them on (whether open market or MBO), to then embracing the change from working – and accumulating assets – to retirement, where we de-accumulate assets whilst being mindful of later life expenses and needs.

My experience has included working for Self-Administered Pension specialist Pointon York; working with wealthy individuals and business owners with Barclays Bank, as well as during my time with Soloman Hare (now merged with Smith & Williamson), before deciding at the end of 1997 that I could do this myself and pass on significant savings to my clients.",,51.5191428,-0.2896614,9/18/2020 19:04,12/2/2020 4:54

For Private Clients

🔸 Tax Planning - You won’t get a prize if you pay more tax than you should. I'll make sure you're taking advantage of all your tax-breaks.
🔸 Pension Planning - Pension Planning - Take control of your pensions now so that you can enjoy the retirement you dream of and not the one you fear. If you're still saving for retirement, I can tell you how much your pension pot could be worth and what you need to do to achieve your pension goals. If you're at retirement, I'll explain all your options and we'll work together to find the best solution for you.
🔸 Estate Planning - The taxman WILL penalise the next generation of your family if he can. Remember, it's your estate not the taxman's. I'll recommend a plan to help your family avoid this.
🔸 Investment Planning - Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it is! Don't take big risks with your hard-earned cash. I can show you how to grow your wealth comfortably using a multi asset, risk targeted investment strategy.
🔸 Protection - Don't spend any more than you have to on protection. I'll consult with you to work out how much money you'll need if you're too ill to work again, and how much your family would need if you die. We'll then work with you to put together an affordable solution.",,51.4791863,-0.0139364,9/22/2020 20:48,9/22/2020 20:54

Throughout the process, the focus is on you and what you want to achieve in life. Money is the fuel that ensures your aspirations can be met.  The personal relationship built and the time dedicated means that these outcomes can't be done on a mass market level.

Can I leave a legacy?
How much do I need to sell my business for to have enough money to live for the rest of my life?

The financial world is complex and is constant state of change, unless you are already a trained professional its hard to navigate and you have a ""day job"" to do besides pursuing your other interests.

My aim is to guide you through the financial world so you can make better informed decisions to achieve good outcomes for you and your family. I understand that every individual is unique and that is why I start with getting to know you and your circumstances then go on to build that relationship for the long term.  Many of my clients will also refer their friends and family as that is how I build my business. 

Mortgages - if that's you just getting on the housing ladder or expanding your property portfolio.I used to own and manage my own estate agency in Croydon,so I  can add value to my advise too.

Investments - If you are concerned with poor returns and the silent attack from inflation, I can help you establish the level of risk you feel comfortable with and explore opportunities for you to ensure that your hard earned cash works for you.

Pensions - If, for example, you've had many employments with several pension funds I can carefully assess what they're costing you, how risky those funds are to your retirement plans and whether it's right for you to consolidate those funds into a single solution that you can keep track of on your laptop at the click of a mouse.

Final Salary Pensions - As a qualified Defined Benefit pension specialist I am authorised to advise you on whether its right to remain with your scheme or move your funds away. 

Transferring out of a Final Salary scheme is unlikely to be in the best interests of most people.

I will only work in your interests as that makes good business sense.

He continued his study to achieve the ‘gold standard’ qualification in his field and now practices as a Chartered Financial Planner. He has also been permissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority as a ‘Pension Transfer Specialist’ advising on occupational pension transfers - although for commercial reasons he has decided not to advise in this area at present. His desire to offer Independent financial advice led Marc to join a local IFA practice where he gained significant experience before setting up Alpha Wealth Management Limited in 2016.

Whilst Marc appreciates clients place their trust in him, his approach to the provision of advice is characterised by his desire to educate clients along their ‘journey’ so that they themselves can make informed decisions based on evidence and sound reasoning.
