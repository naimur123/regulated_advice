Still, the alternative of buying an annuity, means you transfer your pension to an insurance company and forfeit the right to any capital and investment growth from your fund.
Although you receive a guaranteed annuity income for the rest of your life in exchange for your hard-earned pension, annuity rates are currently very low. Plus, you’ll miss out on the potential for any post-retirement growth in your pension investments.","Retirement Income Planning","1","2021-01-19 23:13:36","2021-01-19 23:13:36"

"196","509","What is inheritance tax?","Inheritance tax is a tax on the estate (the property, money and possessions) of someone who's passed away.
How much you pay depends on the value of your estate – which is valued based on your assets (cash in the bank, investments, property or business, vehicles, payouts from life insurance policies), minus any debts.
Importantly, there is normally no tax to pay if either:
•	The value of your estate is below £325,000.
•	You leave everything over £325,000 to your spouse, civil partner, a charity or a community amateur sports club.
If neither of the above applies, your estate will be taxed at 40% on anything above the £325,000 threshold when you die (or 36% if you leave at least 10% of the net value to a charity in your will).
However, this £325,000 tax-free threshold might be higher depending on your circumstances – in some cases as high as £500,000, or even £1 million.
