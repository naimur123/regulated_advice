We take great care to understand your circumstances fully, before delivering any financial advice, to ensure that the solutions we put in place for you, match your requirements as closely as possible.

The Beginning
Tom & Jason started Wealth Aspirations in December 2012 having worked as Independent Financial Advisers at various different companies. January the 1st 2013 was the day of the Retail Distribution Review; the day on which commission was finally scrapped from all investments and the day that required advisers to have a much higher level of knowledge. They decided that, as the industry was growing up and becoming more regulated and required more qualifications, it would be a great time to start Wealth Aspirations. A huge need was identified for independent advisers in light of the countless numbers of 'advisers' being laid off by the major banks alongside a growing market of people like you whom require sound financial advice.",1,9/21/2020 18:03,12525,,xppQjy5rx7UDx5s2toZdCMTKjwStT5NxsKRdbCAziXObgUyQ745mFOXzbifh,53.831625,-1.461564,,,0,9/21/2020 14:41,12/9/2020 17:56,0

One Stop in helping you Remortgage to another lender

The most common reason to Remortgage is usually to move to a cheaper interest rate once a deal has come to an end, however you can remortgage for home improvements, to build an extension, to pay off debts or even to buy another house if you have enough equity in your current home.

One Stop in helping you move home

If You are moving home, you might be asking yourself, what do I do now?.How does moving house with a mortgage work? If you’re looking to move to larger Home or maybe even a smaller home and you already have a mortgage on your current house there will be lots of questions.

One Stop if you are a First Time Buyer

As a First time buyer, you are making your first bold step on to the housing market. When meeting me or chatting with me on the phone i will explain to you the whole process of buying your first home and give you a clear understanding of the home buying process in a manner you will easily understand and working out how much you may need which can be complicated.

You invest your trust in the adviser, expecting them to give you the best possible advice about your finances and how to manage them. It’s a privilege to be asked and a responsibility that cannot be taken too lightly.

Having been providing financial advice to retail clients and commercial organisations since 1993, I’m all too aware of what should happen and very conscious of what can sometimes go wrong. Most financial advisers are excellent, but even the best can give ‘poor advice’ if they can only offer a narrow range of products.

I’m passionate about my profession so, after 20 years in the business, I decided to go it alone and set up my own firm. I wanted to be able to offer my clients a truly independent service; I wanted to be able to offer them what they need and I wanted to be able to offer them the best product available, unhindered by any allegiance. I wanted to do it ‘my way’.

One Financial Solutions was formed in December 2012 and provides independent financial advice to retail and business clients, often encompassing both a client’s personal and business finances.

Our philosophy focuses on building and maintaining a long term and trusted relationship with clients, whilst providing a distinct quality, integrity, and excellence of financial advice. We offer a bespoke and high level personal service that is rarely seen in today’s financial market place. Over the past 9 years, my clients’ satisfaction may be judged by the high volume of new clients I have gained from recommendations and referrals.

Anglian Wealth Management is a member of the successful St. James's Place Partnership, the sole advisory channel for the St. James's Place Wealth Management Group. With advice guaranteed and the ‘Best of Breed’ approach to both products and services, I can ensure that a high standard of advice is consistently provided to clients across Norwich, Norfolk and East Anglia.

Planning for a secure financial future whether for yourself, your family or your business is one of the most important steps you will ever take. It is useful to regularly review your financial situation to take advantage of any developments in legislation and tax law. If there are changes in your circumstances, such as starting a family, changing jobs, starting your own business or receiving an inheritance, a review of your financial goals is crucial.

We provide a personalised wealth management service by working together with our clients to help secure the financial future they are seeking. Through careful planning, and drawing from my many years of experience in the financial field, we can work towards satisfying all your financial goals.

At the heart of the service offered by Anglian Wealth Management is the belief in effective communication to ensure that clients are kept informed of issues that may affect their financial wellbeing. To this end there is a regularly published range of newsletters exclusively for you, including a weekly Monday Markets Bulletin and quarterly magazine, The Investor.

The value of an investment with St. James's Place will be directly linked to the performance of the funds you select and the value can therefore go down as well as up.

About the home you want to buy, the area you want to live in and where you see your future. The trivial alterations through to the bigger ones; the renovation work that needs doing, the extension you want to add, the loft conversion, the drive way that needs paving or just a bit of redecorating. It’s your new home. Your new tomorrow. And it’s pretty damn exciting!

I started Tomorrow Mortgages with the sole aim of delivering a service that is based on trustworthy, transparent, and honest advice. Not on numbers or targets and certainly not on a high client turnover.

I am happy to give you a run down of my past, my hobbies, my career to date, my qualifications and whatever other questions you may have but in order not to bore those of you reading this I’ve tried to keep it short.

I’ve worked in mortgages for 13 years, a decade at Lloyds Banking Group and three years at two of the biggest brokers in the country. As is true for so many of us though the changes bought about in 2020 from the coronavirus pandemic made me re-evaluate my career and how I want to work with clients going forward.

Back to you and your mortgage though, my role in getting you the home you really want to buy is to enable the financial side of things to run as smoothly as possible. Together we can arrange your mortgage, the one that is right for you in terms of duration, rate and repayment, and if you need or want it we can ensure that the right protection is in place for your future.

Whether you’re a first time buyer looking to see how much you can borrow, a current mortgage holder or an investor, feel free to give me a call or drop me an email and we can have a chat through.

You, the client, come first - If we provide you with the best possible financial advice, you will succeed. If you succeed then so shall we.

Integrity and honesty are fundamental - You are putting your trust in us, the very least we can do in return is to act honestly. We have nothing to hide, our activities and the way we work are transparent.

Our reputation is our greatest asset - Our reputation has been built from a combination of the expertise and knowledge of our advisers, maintaining our independence and satisfying our clients’ expectations. We’ve a great reputation, we want to keep it!

We are professionals, providing a professional service in a professional industry

Our knowledge and experience are valuable assets and can provide you with tangible benefits. We are proud about what we’ve done, what we do and what we will do. We are determined to provide an outstanding service for our clients: we’d like you to be proud of us too.

We are fiercely independent - Being independent means we can offer you the best product on the market, not just the best product we have in a brochure. If we can offer you the best product we hope you’ll be delighted with the result.

We give financial advice across the entire market - As a client you will have a broad range of requirements – we need to match that with a broad range of advice and products.

We work holistically - We know, from our own personal experience, that your financial situation is influenced by both your work and your personal life so we need to evaluate your circumstances holistically.

We are individuals but work as a team - As individuals, we can offer advice on some things but not everything. We’re much stronger as a team and together, can offer you much better advice across a wider range of subjects.

Treating Customers Fairly - The FCA’s Treating Customers Fairly policy mirrors our own; its ethos is ingrained within our employees and embedded within everything we do.

Customer Service - We strive to treat you as we would like to be treated: as an individual, with respect, dignity and honesty.

Plain English - For most people, financial services can be confusing and difficult to understand. We try to make it easier to understand by using plain, simple English.

We want to work with you on a long-term basis - The better we know each other, the more successful we can both be. All relationships take time and effort to develop, the benefits of a good relationship are worth the investment.",1,12/7/2020 17:55,12525,,DcllZJubntqEP8fgCkBtEau4lZwNJ8rH0GzpQ7k6wh5hNDYDZrRAxZH23Jar,51.299806,-0.072621,,,0,11/27/2020 17:28,12/11/2020 20:12,0

We have a duty of care to provide advice on the best mortgage or insurance product that matches your specific requirements and personal circumstances.

We use the acronym “KIST” to describe what you can expect from us.  

    Knowledgeable: You will find us up to speed on the latest products and the best providers;
    Integrity: You can rely on us to act ethically, morally and recommend the right solution;
    Service: You can expect an exceptional and personal service; and
    Trust: You can be sure we will treat everything you share with us in strict confidence.

We may be a fairly young business yet we have financed / written over £20m worth of mortgages and protection insurance in just over 2 years.

Who are you?

As a prospective homeowner looking to finance the purchase or someone looking to replace a an existing mortgage you are likely to be spoilt for choice. Choosing the right product and covering the risk can be challenging assuming your affordability (can you afford to service and repay the debit as well as live?) is acceptable to lenders.

We imagine you are like the vast majority of people we talk to though: fed up with ‘experts’ who use jargon and complex phrases that confuse.  We speak your language whether you are a first time buyer, a first time mover, an experienced property investor or someone about to build a buy to let portfolio.

Who are we?

We are people who are here when you need us not here when it suits us. We don’t work 9-5. We recognise that our clients are likely to be busy people who want to talk outside of office hours.

You will find us approachable, receptive, straight talking and above all, great listeners.
