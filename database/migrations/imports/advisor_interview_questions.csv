44,416,,"Sure, I first entered the world of Financial Services in 1997.  After leaving university I started working for a large insurance company, alongside the team of financial advisers working for the firm.  This gave me a real feel for the role and inspired me further to go on and obtain the qualifications I needed to become a financial adviser myself.

I gained my first regulated advice role at the start of 2001 and have been working as a financial adviser since.  I have worked for several companies over that time (both large and small) and for the last 6 years I have been working as a fully independent financial adviser.  After several years of working within the restrictions of various companies, I was regularly frustrated by not always being able to select the absolute best solution for me clients.  Since becoming independent I have been able to work fully on behalf of my clients, which has made the role far more interesting and rewarding.","Quite simply, anyone who needs help in making important financial decisions or plans.","Our needs are often quite simple (to protect our families financially should the worst happen, to provide for a sufficient level of income in retirement etc.) but understanding the best ways to meet those needs can often be daunting.  There are so many different types of products and companies offering those products that understanding which products are best suited to you can be a minefield.  Good financial advice may cost, but not seeking advice can end up being far costlier.","There are almost too many to mention here.  A few would be, not understanding your tolerance to risk and investing within assets that subject your funds to an unsuitable level of risk.  You could be paying more in the way of charges than you should, or you may be investing within assets that are simply performing badly.  Another would be failing to plan correctly for an event (be it a wedding, house or car purchase or a longer term event such as retirement) and then struggling to cope with the demands of the event.  Finally, failing to protect liabilities and loved ones can have a disastrous impact if an accident, sickness or a death removes a significant income from the household.","At Wolds Financial Planning, we have a 4 stage process.

Stage 1 - Consultation - Before any adviser can provide advice, it is vital for them to fully understand the circumstances of their clients.  We always offer a free introductory meeting, where the adviser can discuss the client’s requirements and situation and where the client and adviser can decide if they will be comfortable working together.  The adviser will explain how they work, how they get paid and the services they offer.

From then on the adviser will carry out a ‘fact finding’ exercise where they gather all of the important facts regarding a client’s position, as well as understanding their feelings and emotions towards specific subjects.  This is a very two-way exercise where it is important to build the fullest picture possible.  With regard to investment and retirement planning, this process will involve assessing a client’s attitude towards risk, understanding their aims, objectives, knowledge and experience as well as their capacity to sustain financial loss.

Stage 2 - Advice - Here the adviser will assess all of the information and come up with recommendations to best meet the client's aims & objectives.  This will involve selecting the most suitable products and where relevant, investment strategies.  The recommendations will be presented in a suitability report, along with supporting documentation.

Stage 3 - Implementation - Should you wish to proceed with the advice, your financial adviser will then implement that advice on your behalf.  This will involve applying for the recommended products, completing any required documentation.  Once submitted, your adviser will monitor your applications, to ensure that they proceed correctly.  Once the recommended plans are in place, any plan documentation will then be forwarded to you, either by your adviser or the product providers.

Stage 4 - Ongoing Service/Advice - Many financial plans and products need to be reviewed on a regular basis, to ensure that they continue to meet your needs and remain on track.  This service is optional and has its own annual cost, but involves a full review of your financial situation and existing plans, on at least an annual basis.  Any changes to your financial plans or goals (including your views towards investment risk), your existing plans, or your overall financial situation are taken into account by your adviser.  After completing the review your adviser will either advise that you continue as you are, or that you make some changes.  If any changes are recommended, and you accept the advice, your adviser will then implement this advice for you.","Yes, this is quite often the case.  The financial world is rarely straightforward and it is common for there to be a range of solutions that may be suitable for a client.  One example would be following the huge changes to the rules on accessing pension funds in 2015.  It is easy to read or watch an article on the subject and feel that you then know the right action to take, but quite often, these articles do not take into account the full picture and there may well be an option out there that is more suitable to a client’s specific requirements.

I have reviewed clients who were dead set on on taking a pension fund as cash, only to realise that they would be giving up a fantastic rate of guaranteed retirement income if they did.  After looking at the full picture, they would have been significantly worse off by taking the cash from their pension and therefore changed their minds.  It may have cost them to receive the advice, but had they not elected to take the advice, they could have been thousands of pounds out of pocket and would have lost an important source of guaranteed income at a level which is simply unavailable today.","This does vary based on the type of advice being provided and the level of funds invested.  Typically, if a client was investing a lump sum, we would charge in the region of 3% of the amount invested.  So if a sum of £10,000 was invested, that would equate to around a fee of £300.  If an amount of £50,000 was invested, then the fee would be around £1,500.  The fees can either be paid directly by the client or they can be taken from their investment or pension.  It is down to the client to decide how they pay us.

As well as paying for initial advice, a client may wish to receive on-going advice on their investments or pensions.  For this we would usually charge around 0.75% of the value of the pension or investment per annum.

Advice on protection products (such as protection against death or ill health) is still paid for through commissions paid by the relevant insurance company and we rarely charge any additional fee for this advice.","It can seem like that initially, but hopefully after understanding my earlier points, it is clearer why paying for advice is important.  If an investment does not meet a client’s risk tolerance level, that can lead to them panicking at the wrong time and withdrawing their funds at a significant loss.  If an investment a client has chosen performs badly, then that can see them lose thousands when compared to an investment a regulated adviser may have selected.  Similarly, an investment a client may have selected my have high on-going charges.  The compound effect of these charges can make the charges paid to receive the advice seem tiny in comparison.","This all depends on the type of client and their on-going needs.  Some clients have fairly simple financial needs and are invested within plans which only need to be reviewed on an annual basis.  Some clients have more complex needs, which require several meetings throughout the year, often alongside other financial professionals.  With our Client Access Portal, we are able to keep in closer contact with our clients, through secure messaging and the ability to send documents securely.  Since the start of Covid-19 pandemic, we have also embraced online meetings using Microsoft Teams.  This allows us to easily meet up with clients (albeit virtually) on a more regular basis, if required.",9/18/2020 21:05,9/18/2020 21:05
45,395,,I have worked in financial services for over 25 years and have a wealth of knowledge available to help my clients whatever their needs.,Anyone who wants to maximise their investment or retirement plans or needs mortgage or insurance advice. Investing is a long term business and so the earlier you begin to save the better.,There is plenty of evidence to show how much value seeking advice can add to an investment or pension fund over the long term. Investments and pensions are complex products and there are pitfalls which the average person might not be aware of.  Paying too much tax is a good example. Another example is panic buying or selling when markets are volatile which can have a seriously detrimental effect on the prospect of long term gains. There are those who prefer self investing and that's fine if they have the knowledge and experience to do so.,"Complete loss of money, paying high fees and pension scams are all pitfalls of DIY investing. In general if something seems too good to be true it usually is. Anyone offering guaranteed returns with little or no risk or investments overseas in land/forestry/banana plantations or storage facilities or similar should be avoided. Check with Government websites such as www.unbiased.co.uk or search the FCA register to ensure your adviser is registered.","The first part of the process is a a free telephone consultation to establish customer needs and if the adviser can help. Your adviser will need to complete a fact find to understand your personal and financial position before they can give you advice. When reviewing existing plans a letter of authority would need to be signed and sent to the existing provider so that the adviser can understand the type of plan held, costs, charges and performance. 

Once the existing plan is fully understood the adviser can recommend a solution which in all cases should be better than the existing plan. A recommendation report will be given to you explaining why the new product is better and the reasons for the recommendation. Once you are happy with the recommendation then the adviser will complete all the paperwork and ensure everting is completed quickly and smoothly.",Sometimes objectives change once a realistic plan has been discussed and reviewed. Having a financial adviser means reviewing plans at least once every year to make sure things remain on track.,Pension and investment advice typically costs between 1% and 5% of the investment or pension value depending on the complexity of the plan and the work involved. Your adviser will send you a terms of business document which will highlight the exact fees before they commence any work on your behalf.,It might seem so but there is evidence to show that those who have a financial adviser make substantially better returns over the long term than those who don't.,I meet my clients once each year and complete a full review.

I enjoy discussing current affairs and world events, particularly as this impacts the value of your investment, and can clearly explain the reasons behind the advice I provide in an easy to understand manner.","I specialise in helping those approaching retirement, to review their existing provision and to take a closer look at how they can be looking to improving their rate of growth and to explore the options available to them. 

I also advise many individuals who are disappointed with the low rates of interest earned from the savings which they hold in the Bank and who would like to explore alternative ways in which to generate growth or an income.","It is important to seek advice from a professional who is engaged with the markets on a regular basis and who is knowledgeable around the opportunities and risks attached. It is also imperative that people seek advice when approaching retirement, even if they have not sought advice before, as the options available at retirement have changed in recent years and can appear complex without a professional advisor helping the navigate the path ahead.","Unfortunately we sometimes hear of individuals who have taken their pension as a single lump sum, in which case they will have been taxed at their highest marginal rate of tax, which may have proved very costly and can be avoided with advice. 

The majority of people we meet with haven't benefited from a review of their pensions and investments for a number of years and could benefit from possible changes which I recommend.","Generally we start with an initial consultation, free of charge, which may last anything up to an hour. I would then typically expect to meet with you, either face to face or virtually, on at least 2 further occasions, to gain a deeper understanding of what you are trying to achieve and to undertake an analysis of what you already have in place, in order to share the good and bad parts of what your existing strategy involves and how it can be adapted to benefit you.","Yes, typically, most of clients have an idea which we work with and then this adapts as the meetings progress.","We provide the initial consultations and advice to the point of the recommendation at no cost to you. Depending on whether the recommendation results in a Pension, ISA, Bond or other investment will impact the charge which is levied which only comes into effect if you then choose to proceed with the investment and which I will discuss fully with you as the meetings progress.","Very much like a visit to your GP or Dentist, it often makes sense to spend a small amount in the short term to have the right advice from a professional to maximise the opportunity of making greater, tax-efficient, savings over the longer term. 

I enjoy adding value to our conversations to help you to discover new tax-efficient ways in which to provide growth or an ongoing income.","At least annually, however, as each client's circumstances are different, it can mean that clients want to meet more often, or less often, to make the most of reviews at the times in their lives when they feel it is relevant to them.",11/18/2020 19:53,11/18/2020 19:53

50,411,,"I hail from a farming background in the West Country; I strongly value the ethics and morals associated with honesty and hard work. Perhaps my farming DNA retains the blueprint to carefully and accurately sew the seeds of financial security at the earliest possible opportunity, to then tend (water) cajole and nurture the financial ""crop"" until it is time to reap the harvest in retirement.

My nature is such that I have a strong affinity towards helping others, over a longer period; to not just ""promise results"" but to lead others along the journey, at every twist and turn, to deliver those results whilst adapting to the changes that inevitably life will throw into the equation along the way.","There is a considerable difference between those ""who should be seeking advice"" and those  ""who should be seeking advice from me"". 

From a financial perspective; anyone facing a ""life event"" such as a new job, buying a home etc might need to take advice.

I prefer to work with a limited number of clients, offering a niche service to those who would most benefit from my skills and experience; typically they are individuals/couples perhaps in business or in senior management who are thinking of selling/closing down/handing on the business or else otherwise retiring likely over the next 5 years or so, right then way up to those in later life who wish to consider how best to secure their final years, but to plan to help children/grandchildren too.","I decided a few years ago that the process of charging initial fees for financial advice is/was often (at best) poor value for money. There are a few exceptions to this (see below costs question), but in the majority of cases I do not see initial fees as appropriate.

Instead, I charge an ongoing fee to advise, guide and recommend a ""process"" that will last many years and for a large number of my clients, decades.

In answer to the question then, if it isn't going to cost anything upfront and the only cost would be on-going if you are happy with the advice being given, then why wouldn't you seek advice?

The caveat to that of course is ""relevance"", so I refer you back to my answer to the ""who should be seeking advice"" question; if that fits your scenario then we should speak. For free.","Investment risk, liquidity and timing seem to sum up the majority of the pitfalls I have seen play out over the past (almost) four decades that I have been providing advice.

Sadly, there has always been ""cowboys"", scams etc and I think now we must add in ""fake news"" to that list.

Perhaps though the biggest pitfall is to ""do nothing""; after all, failure to plan is to plan to fail.","This is really quite straightforward in that it's whatever you want it to be, whenever you think it's required

However, if you wish to engage my services, then it has to fall within the following guidelines:-

1) We arrange a telephone conversation - it's usual to exchange an email or two in advance setting the scene to address specific concerns etc 
2) If both parties feel that there is a connection, that help is required and can be given, then the conversation would become more specific in terms of goals/objectives/requirements.
3) Between us we then look to gather relevant information - this would be details of existing investments/pensions etc.
4) We compile this into an agreed summary/snapshot.
5) Recommendations are then made as to any changes/enhancements/structures that may be required at outset and/or a timescale for this.
6) We agree on a servicing/review plan/costing.
7) Then and only then is a plan implemented.
8) We review/adapt in line with our agreement going forward.","No, often though during the advice process those objectives expand or focus.

For example; you may know that you want to retire in x years time, but do not know whether you can afford to do so; the objective is to retire, the advice process will show you how and be with you as you approach retirement and into retirement.","I would love to say ""nothing"" but cannot!

I genuinely love to help and to advise, but unfortunately overheads get in the way of that desire.

I will only charge an initial fee where absolutely necessary and it is usually capped at 1% of the amount of money invested; this rises to 2% ONLY where an Occupational Pension transfer is discussed/considered and that fee would be regardless of the outcome.

The 1% initial fee then will ONLY apply where you are insistent that you DO NOT require an ongoing service, eg for a pension annuity purchase. 

In the vast majority of circumstances then there are NO INITIAL FEES.

The ongoing fee structure is quite simple; it is 0.50% per annum of the value of the money you ask me to advise you over, this includes an annual review meeting (face-to-face when lockdown permits) and unlimited telephone/email contact; where you require much more hands on eg 3 or 4 meetings per year, then the cost rises to 1% per annum.

Usually, fees are paid from within investments, rather than settled personally, but really it is up to you.","Not at all. 

You don't pay anything at all until we officially engage into an agreement to provide you with advice; in the vast majority of cases the fee is on-going monthly only, so if you aren't happy with the advice, you cancel the agreement.","Annually is an absolute minimum; some of my clients prefer quarterly, for most though one or two times per year suits them, with telephone/email catch ups as and when they like.",1/29/2021 18:36,1/29/2021 18:36

Nowadays, people have to shoulder risk leaving no choice but to make private provisions throughout their lifetime and make sure their assets last post retirement. Workplace Pensions have become compulsory in the UK after being imposed by UK legislation onto the private sector emphasising again the importance of building up personal savings.","People can make decisions themselves and particularly with the advent of internet and so much free information, people can find useful information about investing money.

However, the role of a professional financial adviser is different. A financial adviser would help people become the architects of their life first before start investing money and putting plans in place. A financial adviser would also help people articulate goals, ambitions while he would manage their assets in a such a way that life objectives are met whilst protecting them for future generations. He would also be a life guardian, as a kind of lighthouse keeper, scanning the horizon for issues that may affect the client and keeping them informed.

A professional financial adviser is a good listener. The emotions triggered by financial uncertainty are real. A good adviser will listen to clients’ fears, tease out the issues driving those feelings and provide practical long-term answers. A good adviser will also be a good teacher. Getting beyond the fear-and-flight phase often is just a matter of teaching investors about risk and return, diversification, the role of asset allocation and the virtue of discipline. Even when the strategy is in place, doubts and fears inevitably will arise. At this point a good financial adviser becomes a coach, reinforcing first principles and keeping the client on track.

Now, more than ever, investors need advisers who can provide client-centred expertise in assessing the state of their finances and developing risk-aware strategies to help them meet their lifetime goals.","Financial Planning is people’s life journey with ups and downs and constant changes in legislation, markets and politics. These changes represent risk but also opportunity. The global financial turmoil of recent years (2008) demonstrated the value of an independent and objective voice in a world full of free internet information, product pushers and salespeople.","There is more to financial planning than selling a financial product or accumulating financial products over the years. Strategic Financial Planning is the process of developing and maintaining a viable fit between your objectives and finances. The aim of financial planning is to combine your assets based on a structured, well thought-out methodology with a view to achieving your goals. To understand financial planning, you have to remember how the modern company operates: It needs to have a business plan and a strategy; It also needs to produce a cash flow statement, balance sheet, profit/loss account to ascertain its position at any given point in time. Personal Financial Planning is no different.

The reality of personal financial planning is a complexity of multiple financial plans set up to achieve personal objectives, with many variables affecting delivery. Unless objectives are specified through a carefully designed hierarchy then individuals find difficulty in achieving. The purpose of identifying the individual’s personal objectives is to assign to these objectives specific financial plans. The objectives need to be, Acceptable, Flexible, Measurable, Motivating, Suitable, Understandable, Achievable.

Once the objectives and financial plans have been set for the designated time periods, attention must be directed to their FUTURE REVIEW and REVISION.

Periodic revision of your plan is very IMPORTANT; Aspirations and expectations are likely to change over time, including changes due to change of jobs, house, marriage or divorce, changes in the financial markets, legislation and so on; It is also important in order to re establish the ASSUMPTIONS made at outset. A natural change is likely to require revision as you go through the life cycle. There are many areas that need to be identified, addressed and ultimately integrated: Income tax, risk management, retirement planning, investment planning, estate planning, business financial planning.","Not usually, but as we all know life is full of ups and downs.

Equity release is different from other forms of borrowing because you don’t have to make any monthly repayments unless you want to. Therefore if the interest is not paid it will ' roll up' or 'compound'.
As the interest is rolled up, then the total amount to be repaid could increase significantly over time.
Just like any mortgage or other form of borrowing, both the amount you initially borrow plus the accruing interest must be repaid at some point in the future, with an Equity Release this is when you permanently vacate the property i.e in the event of death, moving or being taken in to permanent full time care.
Depending on your provider you may be required to pay early repayment charges in certain circumstances if you repay your borrowing early.

This gives the adviser a clear idea of what the objectives are, how much money is to be released and also when the money is intended to be released. In the industry it is classed as a fact find. Research is then completed from the whole of the market, and then a written report produced which is then discussed at a further meeting.","On occasions, client's can change their initial objectives following the first meeting, even after the second meeting.

I grew up in North London / South Hertfordshire - I now live in Northampton town centre.,Anyone who's profile or requirements doesn't fit normal mortgage lending criteria and who is therefore struggling to get a mortgage should be seeking advice. Anyone who is struggling to obtain the amount of mortgage they require should be seeking advice. As a whole of market mortgage advisor I am able to access all the mortgage lenders to obtain the best levels of borrowing and it is my job to know the lending criteria of these mortgage lenders.,"Even for someone who is able to obtain a mortgage for themselves, deciding upon the right mortgage product and the right term of mortgage for their needs and requirements is not straight forward so it is worth seeking advice. A mortgage advisor will ensure that any mortgage recommended is affordable. A mortgage advisor also has all the experience of completing mortgage applications and knowing what supporting documents / evidence are required by mortgage lenders so the whole process is generally more efficient going through a mortgage advisor.",Being short on affordability i.e. being unable to afford the monthly mortgage repayments for the mortgage amount that is required. Not having adequate proof of income. Wanting a mortgage term that goes beyond intended retirement age. Not having a sufficient deposit to meet the mortgage lender's minimum deposit requirement.,A customer will make an initial mortgage enquiry - I will speak to that customer and try to establish why they need a mortgage. I will introduce my services and explain Data Protection. Once my Privacy Notice has been accepted by the client I would then obtain further information from the client by way of a Fact Find to establish what their mortgage requirements are in full. I would also obtain proof of ID and proof of address as well as supporting documents from my client. I would then research the mortgage marketplace to find mortgage lenders who are able to assist and identify the mortgage lender among them who is offering the best terms. I would then produce a Key Features Illustration for a suitable mortgage product and explain the key features of this product. Once I have obtained the client's permission to proceed on this basis I would send my client a suitability letter explaining the reasons I have recommended the mortgage lender and mortgage product and explaining how this mortgage product meets their needs and requirements. I would then obtain my client's permission to obtain a mortgage agreement in principle - once this has been obtained I would then proceed with completing and submitting a full mortgage application.,Sometimes a client's initial objective changes following their first meeting - for example it may be that as a result of the meeting the client concludes that they may have to wait a little while longer before being able to apply for a mortgage e.g. because they need more time to save up a sufficient deposit. Sometimes a client hasn't given sufficient thought about when they plan to retire and this will affect the mortgage term that is most suitable for them.,The advice I provide is free. Depending on the complexity of the mortgage requirement I may charge a mortgage offer fee of up to £495 but this is only payable once I have obtained a full mortgage offer from the mortgage lender.,The advice I provide is free.,I review my client's financial situation every year.,5/26/2021 16:36,5/26/2021 16:36
