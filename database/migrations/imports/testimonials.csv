I had released equity on my bungalow in 2007, but was increasingly aware that current interest rates were at rock bottom,  whilst I was still committed to adding the 5.85% annually to my lifetime mortgage.
I had advised a friend to release some funds on her unencumbered property in order to make improvements, and she was advised by her solicitor to consult Apex CB. When she showed me the offer which she received as a result of Liz's advice,  I immediately contacted Liz, who thoroughly checked my financial situation before introducing me to LV Equity Release. The final result is that having cleared my former high interest lifetime mortgage and added some more equity release I will over a period of  10 years save approximately Â£11,000.",1,447,10/7/2020 17:56,10/7/2020 17:56

Volunteer STEM Ambassador at Catalyst Science Discovery

I was contacted by Jim in 2017 after I had requested a pension review. Jim took details of all my pensions including a former defined benefits scheme in a face to face meeting. Jim contacted all my pension holding companies for a transfer value. Jim explained the necessary steps and identified a suitable SIPP to transfer to and then gave an excellent presentation of the results. There was advice but no pressure. I decided to take early retirement on the basis of Jim's advice. Jim tries not to use jargon but will explain everything where needed. I have retained Jim as my advisor for ongoing pension management. Jim's knowledge and advice has been very comforting during the COVID pandemic. I would recommend Jim to people as a financial advisor.",1,442,10/13/2020 1:17,10/13/2020 1:17
79,Christine Hilton,Newton Le Willows,1,"I have had the pleasure in knowing Jim Coudis for around twelve years after being put in touch with him through another colleague via the Yorkshire Bank who I had dealings with at the time.
 From the very start he made me feel comfortable discussing financial matters and going into great detail to help me understand and make the right decisions for me and since then has helped me greatly to build up a personnel portfolio which includes Pension, Investments, Isa's and Inheritance Tax planning.
I feel in this day and age with technology as it is, that man management has deteriorated and many matters are dealt with over the telephone or by emails and the personnel touch has gone. I am so glad to say that Jim is very much a person to person advisor. He prefers to discuss what can be very important issues for many people, like myself, details of financial planning, by meeting his clients and building up a trusting and friendly professional relationship.
I have recommended him to other members of my family who have been very happy to use his professional services and would not hesitate in recommending him to anyone thinking of seeking financial advice on any matter they may have, knowing that Jim would give them the very best of his knowledge from his years of experience.
